THE SECOND COMING

TURNING AND TURNING IN THE WIDENING GYRE
THE FALCON CANNOT HEAR THE FALCONER
THINGS FALL APART THE CENTRE CANNOT HOLD
MERE ANARCHY IS LOOSED UPON THE WORLD
THE BLOOD DIMMED TIDE IS LOOSED AND EVERYWHERE
THE CEREMONY OF INNOCENCE IS DROWNED
THE BEST LACK ALL CONVICTION WHILE THE WORST
ARE FULL OF PASSIONATE INTENSITY

SURELY SOME REVELATION IS AT HAND
SURELY THE SECOND COMING IS AT HAND
THE SECOND COMING HARDLY ARE THOSE WORDS OUT
WHEN A VAST IMAGE OUT OF SPIRITUS MUNDI
TROUBLES MY SIGHT A WASTE OF DESERT SAND
A SHAPE WITH LION BODY AND THE HEAD OF A MAN
A GAZE BLANK AND PITILESS AS THE SUN
IS MOVING ITS SLOW THIGHS WHILE ALL ABOUT IT
WIND SHADOWS OF THE INDIGNANT DESERT BIRDS

THE DARKNESS DROPS AGAIN BUT NOW I KNOW
THAT TWENTY CENTURIES OF STONY SLEEP
WERE VEXED TO NIGHTMARE BY A ROCKING CRADLE
AND WHAT ROUGH BEAST ITS HOUR COME ROUND AT LAST
SLOUCHES TOWARDS BETHLEHEM TO BE BORN
